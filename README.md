 When the Titanic slipped beneath the icy Atlantic, it wasn’t just steel and rivets that were tested; it was people. 
In the scramble for lifeboats, the numbers tell a sobering story of who society chose to save.
Women, clutching children and shawls, were far more likely to step into the night air and survive;
nearly three in four made it, compared with fewer than one in five men left standing on the slanted decks.
The invisible velvet rope of class mattered, too: first-class passengers, wrapped in fur and certainty, 
survived at twice the rate of those in steerage, where locked gates and confusion turned hopes into whispers. 
Yet the data also remind us that even amid disaster, family offered a fragile shield.
A young mother with one child at her side had better odds than a lone teenager, while large, 
tightly packed families found their numbers suddenly a burden. Geography played its part:
the lucky few who’d boarded at Cherbourg, mostly the well-heeled, stepped into lifeboats with
an almost businesslike calm, while those who’d trooped aboard at Southampton or Queenstown faced
starker choices. In the end, the Titanic’s ledger reads like a snapshot of 1912 society:
women before men, rich before poor, and in every life saved or lost,
a quiet verdict on who the world valued most.
